# Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs (SICP)

This repository contains all of the code that I have written and will write as I
read the above book.

The scheme interpreter that I am using
is [Chez Scheme](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme).

The book can be found online, read as html or pdf, for free [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).
